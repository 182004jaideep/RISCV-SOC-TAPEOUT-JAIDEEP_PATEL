# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)
**RISC-V VSD Participants – India**
My 20-week journey in the VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — documenting the full RTL → GDSII → silicon flow on SCL180nm. Includes weekly progress, scripts, and reusable documentation to serve as a reference for future SoC designers.
